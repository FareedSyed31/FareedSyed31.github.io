<h2 class="headings"><b>About me:</b></h2>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!<br>
    Problem-solving has always been a passion of mine. If it werenâ€™t for engineering, not sure what I'd be doing.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a tech-enthusiast and a fourth-year student majoring in Mechatronics Engineering and minoring in Computer
    Science at Ryerson University in Toronto. Areas like Automation controls, Robotics, Power and Energy interest
    me,
    but I'm always looking for opportunities to diversify my professional experience and expand my horizons.
    I want to continue to use my experience working in a team-oriented environment and managing time-sensitive
    projects
    to both grow myself professionally and contribute to the success of others. <br><br>
